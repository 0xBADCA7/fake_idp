# Fake IdP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/healthify/fake_idp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/healthify/fake_idp)

## About

This is an open source Ruby gem intended for developers needing to spin up a fake Identity Provider (IdP) for testing SAML authentication flows. It's made by the [Healthify](http://healthify.us) team. It's _not_ for setting up an IdP within Healthifyâ€”to do that, you'll need to reach out to integrations@healthify.us.

## Installation

Clone the repo and `cd` into the project directory.

```sh
bin/setup
```

## Running in Development

To run locally, you first need to set up the following environment variables:

|Variables|Description|
|---|---|
|CALLBACK_URL|The URL of the Healthify app to POST to for SAML authentication - required|
|NAME_ID|Name_id of the user you want to log in as - may be nil/blank|
|SSO_UID|Unique id of the user you want to log in as - may be nil/blank|
|USERNAME|Username of the user you want to log in as - may be nil/blank|
|ENCRYPTION_ENABLED|Determines whether the generated assertion should be encrypted or not. Defaults to true|

The `.env.example` file has examples of what these env variables could look like.
You can copy that over to your own `.env` file to set these environment variables:

    cp .env.example .env

Next, to start the server, you can run:

```sh
bin/server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:9292/saml/auth` to begin making your SAML requests.

## Running in Test

### Gemfile

If you are using this gem to provide a Fake IDP server in a test suite, add the gem to the Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fake_idp', github: 'healthify/fake_idp'
```

### Configuration

You can set the relevant variables in a configuration block if they aren't provided as environment variables. For example:

```ruby
FakeIdp.configure do |config|
  config.callback_url = 'http://localhost.dev:3000/auth/saml/devidp/callback'
  config.sso_uid = '12345'
  config.name_id = 'user@example.com'
  config.username = nil
  config.idp_certificate = "YOUR CERT HERE"
  config.idp_secret_key = "YOUR KEY HERE"
  config.algorithm = :sha512
  config.additional_attributes = { custom_saml_attr: "DELIVERED_IN_ASSERTION" }
end
```

#### Resetting Configuration

If you ever want to reset your FakeIdp configuration (e.g. between test specs), you can use the following:

```ruby
FakeIdp.reset!
```

### Use

You can use Capybara Discoball to spin `FakeIdp::Application` up in a test:

```ruby
require 'fake_idp'

before(:each) do
  FakeIdp.configure do |config|
    config.callback_url = callback_url
    config.sso_uid = sso_uid
    config.name_id = name_id
  end
end

it 'logs the sso user in' do
  Capybara::Discoball.spin(FakeIdp::Application) do |fake_idp_server|
    # ...
  end
end
```
